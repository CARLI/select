# Continous Integration

## CARLI - Build

* On each commit to develop, Jenkins builds and run tests for all components.
* If successful and passing all tests, Jenkins creates or updates the appropriate LXC containers for each component, and deploys them to carli.dev.pixotech.com.
* Promoting a build triggers the *Publish to QA* job.

## CARLI - Publish to QA

* The LXC containers generated by the promoted build are deployed to carli.qa.pixotech.com.
* Jenkins merges the appropriate commit into the `qa` branch and push to bitbucket.
* JIRA monitors the `qa` branch and transistions tickets (or add a tag) to indicate that the ticket is now live on QA.

## CARLI - Publish to Production

* Behaves identically to the Publish to QA job, but uses the `master` branch rather than `qa`.
