# Getting Started #

These instructions will get you started working on the browser client (Front End).
All of the instructions in this document, and all front-end work in general is done in
the browserClient/ directory. (It is called browser client because it is the part of the
app that runs in the browser. And it is a client of the API).

At present the project does not use a VM, so all development is done directly in your main OS.


## Install Node ##
The development environment depends heavily on Node and npm.
Visit the [Node Web Site](http://nodejs.org/) for installation instructions.


## Install Dependencies ##
In the browserClient/ directory, run:

* `npm install`
* `npm install -g grunt-cli`
* `npm install -g bower`
* `bower install`


## Start Local Dev Server ##
To build the project and start a local development server:
* `grunt serve`

This should open in a new browser window / tab.  
 

## Live Reloading ##
The development server will auto-refresh when pertinent project files are changed.
Keep an eye on the terminal window to see what happens. Different tasks are run depending on which type of file changed:

* Gruntfile.js - the Gruntfile is reloaded
* Any .js file in carliApp/ - the file will be linted and karma tests will run, then the server will reload.
* If any .js file is added or removed from carliApps/ then the server will reload with an updated index.html containing the correct script tags. (This may not be 100% working).
* If index.html changes the server reloads with the new index.html
* If any .spec.js (test files) change, they are linted and then karma will re-run the tests.


## Other Grunt Tasks ##
The following shortcut tasks are defined. See the [Gruntfile](../Gruntfile.js) for more details.

* `grunt build` - generates a clean build of the project for the dev server. Files are copied to the __build/__ directory.
* `grunt test` - does a clean build then runs the tests. Outputs a junit XML file of the results.
* `grunt serve` - builds and starts a live-reloading server. Opens index.html in a browser window.
* `grunt compile` - packages and minifies the app for deployment. Files are copied into the __dist/__ directory.
* `grunt ngdoc` - build Angular JS documentaion for the application.


## Technology Used ##
The following applications and projects are used to build the front-end, and to aid in development.

* Node - the JavaScript runtime that powers many of the rest of the tools and provides a local development server.
* Grunt - the task runner that automates building the project.
* Bower - a package manager for front-end libraries (Angular, Bootstrap, etc.)
* Karma - a test runner for JavaScript.
* Mocha and Chai - libraries for writing tests.
* PhantomJS - a headless WebKit browser environment in which to run tests.
* Angular - Superheroic JavaScript MVW Framework.
* Browserify - packages code using Node-style `requires` for the browser.

_See [package.json](package.json) and [bower.json](bower.json) for detailed dependency information_


## How to Add a New Front-End Third Party Dependency (Bower Module) ##
Since Bower is used to handle front end dependencies, it must be used when adding new ones. Follow these steps to do so:

* `bower install <package name>` - this will download the package and put it in bower_modules/
* If you are sure you will be using the package, use `bower install --save <package name>` instead. That will save it in bower.json
* Add the path to the file that should be included in the project to the 'vendor_files' section of build.config.js, inside the 'js' array.

If you want to update an existing dependency to a newer version, edit bower.json and increase the number next to the package name.


### Code Style ###
* The Angular application should follow the [Angular Style Guide] as closely as possible.
* JSDoc style documentation is built using ngdoc.  For details of how to write documentation comments, see [Writing AngularJS Documentation].

### Organization ###
The client application is organized according to the [Google Best Practices Doc].
Test files for all of the above live alongside the code they test, and end with .spec.js.

* The __carliApp/__ directory contains index.html and main app config.
* __carliApp/sections/__ contains a directory for each main section of the app and routing configuration for the sections.
    * These directories map to the top-level navigation of the site. They contain the minimal controller and template code to show the section. 
    * There are subdirectories for subsections.
* __carliApp/components/__ contains a directory for each UI component (re-usable and otherwise).
    * There is a directory for each component, which contain controllers, directives, services, and filters. Each in its own file.


### Notes for Linux Users ###
* PhantomJS requires a freetype shared library to run.
Install if you get an error like "Can't start PhantomJS":
`sudo apt-get install libfreetype6 libfontconfig`


### Note for Debian and Ubuntu users installing Node via apt-get ###
See [this article](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/installing-node.js-via-package-manager) for special installation steps.
