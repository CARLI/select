    <h1>Dashboard</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the CARLI Selection Editor! This is where you can train and test on the new system before it is
        launched. This is your dashboard. Currently, we are using it for general notifications, but this area will be
        populated with real content as we continue development.</p>

    <p>If you encounter an issue that you would like to report, please click on the Report a Bug tab in the bottom right
        corner of the screen. Be sure to include as much information about the issue as possible.</p>
