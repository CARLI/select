# v0.9.3

The "Don't Be Hasty" release.

* Remove `ruby-mode` package (fixes several issues)
* Add `name` to metadata (also fixes several issues)
* Create test kitchen harness
* CHEF is now the maintainer
* Create `cookbook_version` attribute to specify the version originating from the cookbook. **This is an internally used attribute primarily, and may change in the future, or be removed**.
